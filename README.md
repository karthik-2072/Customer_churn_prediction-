# Customer Churn Prediction Model using SAS and Excel

## Overview
This project involves developing a **Customer Churn Prediction Model** using **SAS** for data preprocessing, logistic regression, and decision tree modeling. The project leverages customer data from **Excel** to predict which customers are likely to churn, helping marketing teams take proactive measures to improve customer retention.

The project also includes the automation of model training and the generation of interactive churn rate dashboards, providing marketing teams with actionable insights.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  Cleaned, merged, and transformed large datasets (customer behavior, transaction history, demographics) using SAS, handling missing values and outliers for accurate predictions.
  
- **Predictive Modeling**:  
  Developed **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree models** to predict the likelihood of customer churn. The model was trained and evaluated with metrics such as **AUC-ROC**, **precision**, and **recall**.

- **Automation with SAS Macros**:  
  Automated data ingestion, preprocessing, model building, and result generation with **SAS Macros**. This reduced manual effort and allowed for seamless model retraining as new data became available.

- **Dynamic Dashboards**:  
  Integrated **Excel** templates to create automated, interactive **churn rate dashboards**. These visualizations helped marketing teams monitor churn rates and make informed decisions based on real-time data.

- **Model Retraining**:  
  Set up a workflow to **update and retrain the model** on a monthly basis with new customer data to ensure the accuracy of predictions over time.
